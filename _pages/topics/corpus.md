Synthesising, understanding or recognising pathological speech are currently big problems. This dataset is aimed to those
people who want to investigate new avenues of solving this problem, but lack the data to do so. 

This site's purpose is to inform interested people about the changes and recent developments in the oral cancer speech
dataset, and provide links to the publications using it.
