I'm a machine learning researcher focusing on speech technology for pathological speech.
I have worked on a broad range of projects including automatic speech recognition, voice conversion, speech enhancement,
acoustical signal processing and speaker recognition.

I'm currently a research engineer at Oxford Wave Research Ltd.

I'm learning Japanese language as a hobby. 日本語[土手](https://youtu.be/Hr2pUnf5OeM)じゃないです。
