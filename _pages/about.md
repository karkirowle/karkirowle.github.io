I'm a machine learning researcher focusing on speech technology, and especially speech technolology
for pathological speech. I'm doing a PhD at the Netherlands Cancer Institute as an external student of the University of Amsterdam.
I'm also visiting researcher at TU Delft.

Current work
======

Currently I'm doing my PhD at the Netherlands Cancer Institute as an external student of the University of Amsterdam. I'm working on pathological speech synthesis in order to help clinical decisions here in the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital for oral cancer patients.
