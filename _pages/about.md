I'm a machine learning researcher focusing on speech technology for pathological speech.
I have worked on a broad range of projects including automatic speech recognition, voice conversion, speech enhancement,
acoustical signal processing and speaker recognition.

I speak English, Japanese, and Hungarian (my native language).
